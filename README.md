## **My Projects for the specialization of : _TensorFlow Advanced Techniques Specialization from deeplearning.ai_**

* Course 1 : Knowing how to use and customize the TF API.
  - Building multi output model.
  - Using custom layers / models / losses / optimizers / callbacks.
  - Implementing those custom parameters from scratch.
  - Building Vgg / resnet from scratch.
  
* Course 2 : Applying advanced TF functionalities for effective custom-training process.
  - Gradient tape usage.
  - Applying custom training loops.
  - Ising Autograph to use the graph-style code instead of Eager Excution.
  - Applying the different strategies for training, depending on the resourcess available.

* Course 3 : Advanced Computer vision techniques related to state of the art models and tasks.
  - Creating an Object localization model from scratch.
  - Using the Object Detection API for inference.
  - Pretraining and using Retina-net for object detection.
  - Building U-net / VGG - FCN-8 encoder-decoder / Mask R-CNN models from scratch and using them for image segmentation.
  - Interpreting the CNNs and how to visualize the performance of each layer in the network using various methods.
  
* Course 4 : still didn't air yet.
  - Building Neural Style Transfere from scratch.
  - Building AutoEncoders and Deep AutoEncoders.
  - Building Convolutional AutoEncoders from scratch and Applying it to several Datasets.
  - Building Variational AutoEncoders from scratch and Applying it to several Datasets.
  - Using VAEs to generate Anime Faces. -needed more like another day of training tho-
  - Building Vanilla-GAN and DCGAN from scratch.
  - Using DCGANs to generate hand sign images.
